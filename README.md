# Building and Road Segmentation of Geospatial Images 

[![Python application](https://github.com/Luke-Pratley/building_road_segmentation/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Luke-Pratley/building_road_segmentation/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

In this repository I investigate ways to semantically segment buildings and roads in top down. The motivation is that humanitarian and natural disasters can impact roads and buildings, and having a tool that can quickly survey them is useful.


The training and test data is taken from two SpaceNet competitions [2 and 3](https://spacenet.ai/spacenet-buildings-dataset-v2/), where the road and building data are cross matched.
